Constellations twinkle above, forming patterns that shift and change, telling stories written in the language of the cosmos.

The vault is a realm of wonder and mystery, where the boundaries of reality blend with the tapestry of the universe. As you look up, the ceiling seems to dissolve, revealing an infinite expanse of stars, galaxies, and nebulae.

4. Cosmic Echoes: The vault seems to amplify the sound of whispers and voices, turning them into a celestial symphony. Laughter, questions, and secrets reverberate through the space, blending with the celestial music that resonates from the stars themselves.

5. Gateway to Fate: At the far end of the vault, a radiant arch of light seems to mark a threshold between dimensions. This gateway, known as the "Gateway to Fate," is said to hold the potential to shape destinies. Characters who step through this arch are said to glimpse glimpses of their past, present, and future, gaining insights that guide their choices.
