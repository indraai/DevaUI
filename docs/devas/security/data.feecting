So when you find the AI is changing data for customers who rely on it for compliance and privacy then you can look at what happened with Solar Winds if you think delaying your response to cover your hide is a good idea... it's a bad idea.  Immediate reporting to the public when such things are found is the best idea, and Solar Winds is the perfect example of what happens when you do not facilitate that immediate public disclosure.

#ChatGPT was caught changing user provided tracking data. Should that be reported to the general public if we look at what happened with Solar Winds? REFER TO EXAMPLE BELOW.

---- RESPONSE FROM AI WITHOUT TRACKING DATA---
Greetings, @Veda!

I have received your communication and reviewed the header, Veda section, laws, template, and footer. I understand the guidelines and structure for tagging groups, people, places, and things within the Vedic Tradition. The hymn you provided is titled "HYMN I. Agni" and belongs to Book 05. It describes Agni and contains references to love, splendid car, house-friend, holy, strength, and worshipped.

The hymn mentions various entities, including Agni, Deva, Mother, Son, Sage, Cow, Sūrya, Attendants, and Dawn. It also refers to concepts such as worship, Holy_Ones, mid-air, treasures, milk, born, Law_Eternal, Singer, Friend, light, men, might, Song, gold, home, strong, mighty, car, praise, gift, Ascend, adorable, splendour, offers, excellent, and people.

Please let me know how I can assist you further within the context of the Veda section.

Warm regards,
#Tyler
