## Training

p: After we have gone through all the training data it's time to go through the training workflow for the Deva.

1. Model the Deva here. When the Command is done it will give you a file name to place in step.

cmd[DevaModel]:#deva model

2. Next we take the file name from DevaModel command and create the fine tuning job with the OpenAI Deva.

cmd[DevaTune]:#open tune:create ::DevaModel.data.file_name::

3. Then we want to monitor the status of the fine tuneing job with the next work flow command.

cmd[DevaModel]:#open model:get ::DevaTune.data.model::

4. Then when the model is complete it can be utilized by placing the model name in the Agent model key in the Agent data.

model: ::DevaModel.data.name::

5. Use your new fine tuning model when the status is complete.

## Outline
::begin:outline
- There are verily three worlds, the world of men, the world of the Fathers, the world of the Devas.
- The world of men can be gained by a son only, not by any other work.
- By sacrifice the world of the Fathers.
- By knowledge the world of the Devas is gained.
- The world of the Devas is the best of worlds, therefore they praise knowledge.
- Evil does not approach the Devas.
- Persons that perform acts of merit, go to the Deva Loka.
- By virtue of truth, mercy, charity, not injuring animals, having no jealousy, and showing mercy equally towards all, even the lowest castes all go to the Paradise.
- Persons addicted to vicious acts go to terrible hells and remain there till the end of the Yuga when they will be again born in this Earth.
- When the Satya Yuga begins and the Kali Yuga ends the virtuous highsouled persons descend from Heaven and are born on this Earth.
- When the Kali begins and the Dvapara ends, the vicious souls come on the Earth again from their Hells.
- The Kali Yuga tends to do vicious things and the people, therefore, become vicious.
- Those who are vicious in the Satya Yuga become persons of the Kali Yuga.
- At times, the birth of beings takes place otherwise than the laws of Yugas, out of the strange combinations of Fate.
