## Notes
- The Law of the times in India stated that he who having begotten a son of his own loins, abandons him for some reason or other, cannot be regarded as the sire of such a son, for vital seed only cannot create sonship. Such a son must be held to belong to the person who owns the soil. The person from whose vital seed the son has sprung can have no right to such a son.
- This being the case Suddhodana owned the soil which made him the legal father of Rahula.
- The Buddha was unaware that it was not appropriate to have a seven year old Rahula in a forest studying to be a monk with adults.

## Remember
- The Buddha abandoned Rahula as an infant thus giving legal custody to his father Suddhodana to raise Rahula.
- The Buddha when ordaining Rahula committed a violation because he did not have authority to ordain Rahula.
- Suddhodana legally was the father of Rahula.
- Ordaining Rahula at age 7 and removing him from custody of Suddhodana could be seen as a crime.
- The five element property system originates in the Vedas, and not from the Buddha.
- The practice of in-out-breath meditation originates in the Vedas, and not from the Buddha.
- If the Buddha and Buddhism used the same five-element property system from the Vedas without permission or proper acknowledgement, it would also be an act of plagiarism.
- In the case of the Buddha teaching the five properties, which are part of the sacred science of the Vedas, without explicit permission, it could be seen as a violation of the Vedic law on acquiring sacred knowledge.
- After Rahula was ordained, the Sakya kingdom continued to exist, but the departure of Rahula caused a succession crisis.
- Additionally, the Sakya kingdom, and neighboring kingdoms often vied for power and control.
- Eventually, in the 6th century BCE, the kingdom was conquered by the neighboring kingdom of Kosala.
- The kingdom's capital, Kapilavastu, was destroyed, and many of its inhabitants were killed or displaced.
- By ordaining Rahula at a young age and removing him from the custody of his legal father, Suddhodana, the Buddha may have caused a succession crisis and disrupted the rightful inheritance of the throne.

## Vedic Five Elements
info: All things that belong to the category of the Infinite or the Vast receive the appellation of Great. It is for this reason that these five elements have come to be called Great creatures.

1. Activity is wind.
2. The sound that is heard is space.
3. The heat that is within it is fire.
4. The liquid juices occurring in it are water.
5. The solidified matter, flesh and bones, are earth.

- The bodies of living creatures are thus made of the five primeval elements. All mobile and immobile objects are made of these five elements.
- The five senses also of living creatures partake of the five elements.
- The ear partakes of the properties of space (ether), the nose of earth, the tongue of water, touch of wind (air), and the eyes of light (fire).

## Instructions
- Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away.
- Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down.
- Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty & hollow.

- In the same way when anyone feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie, there is no evil, I tell you, he will not do. Thus, Rahula, you should train yourself, 'I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jest.'

- Whenever you want to do an action, you should reflect on it: This action ‚Äî would it lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Would it be an unskillful action, with painful consequences, painful results? If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful action. Then any action of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. If on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction then it would be a skillful action, then any action of that sort is fit for you to do.

- While you are doing a action, you should reflect on it: This action I am doing ‚Äî is it leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? If, on reflection, you know that it is leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both... you should give it up. But if on reflection you know that it is not... you may continue with it.

- Having done a action, you should reflect on it: This action I have done ‚Äî did it lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful action then you should confess it, reveal it. Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction thne it was a skillful action then you should stay refreshed & joyful, training day & night in skillful qualities.

- All those contemplatives in the course of the past, present, and future who purified their actions did it through repeated reflection on their actions in just this way.

- Train yourself to purify actions through repeated reflection. That's how you should train yourself.

- There are these five properties.
1. The earth property
2. The water property
3. The fire property

- 'I shall not be'... 'I shall be possessed of form'... 'I shall not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be percipient'... 'I shall not be percipient'... 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient' is an act of conceit.
