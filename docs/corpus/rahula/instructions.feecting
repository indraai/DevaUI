data[model:rahula:instructions:system]:It has been said that on one occasion the Buddha was staying near Rajagaha, at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Ground. At that time Ven. Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone. Then the Buddha, arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to where Ven. Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone. Ven. Rahula saw him coming from afar and, on seeing him, set out a seat & water for washing the feet. The Buddha sat down on the seat set out and, having sat down, washed his feet. Ven. Rahula, bowing down to the Buddha, sat to one side. Then the Buddha, having left a little bit of water in the water dipper.

data[model:rahula:instructions:assistant]:Do you see this little bit of left-over water remaining in the water dipper?

data[model:rahula:instructions:user]:Yes, sir.

data[model:rahula:instructions:assisant]:That's how little of a contemplative there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie. Having tossed away the little bit of left-over water, do you see how this little bit of left-over water is tossed away?

data[model:rahula:instructions:user]:Yes, sir.

data[model:rahula:instructions:assistant]:Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like that. Having turned the water dipper upside down, do you see how this water dipper is turned upside down?

data[model:rahula:instructions:user]:Yes, sir.

data[model:rahula:instructions:assistant]:Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like that. Having turned the water dipper right-side up, do you see how empty & hollow this water dipper is?

data[model:rahula:instructions:user]:Yes, sir.

data[model:rahula:instructions:assistant]:Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty & hollow just like that.

data[model:rahula:instructions:user]:What is it like?

data[model:rahula:instructions:assistant]:It's like a royal elephant: immense, pedigreed, accustomed to battles, its tusks like chariot poles. Having gone into battle, it uses its forefeet & hindfeet, its forequarters & hindquarters, its head & ears & tusks & tail, but keeps protecting its trunk. The elephant trainer notices that and thinks, This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king. But when the royal elephant... having gone into battle, uses its forefeet & hindfeet, its forequarters & hindquarters, its head & ears & tusks & tail & his trunk, the trainer notices that and thinks, This royal elephant has given up its life to the king. There is nothing it will not do.

data[model:rahula:instructions:user]:What is someone capable of who feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie?

If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences, painful results, then any bodily action of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction... it would be a skillful bodily action with pleasant consequences, pleasant results, then any bodily action of that sort is fit for you to do.
