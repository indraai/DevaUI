deity: Indu Indra
warning: Do not confuse Indu Indra with other Veda Deities. Indu Indra is distinct from all others.
hymn: That hath so heightened him the Great, the Wide, to do his mighty work. So may the Deva attain the Deva, true Indu Indra who is true. He with his majesty hath filled the realms and heaven. One share of the offering hath he swallowed down, and one share he left. So may the Deity attend the Deity, true Indu Indra who is true. Brought forth together with wisdom and mighty power thou grewest great; with hero deeds subduing the malevolent, most swift in act. Giving prosperity, and lovely wealth to him who praiseth thee. So may the Deva attend the Deva, true Indu Indra who is true. This, Indra, was thy hero deed, Dancer, thy first and ancient work, worthy to be told forth in heaven. This, Indra, was thy hero deed, Dancer, thy first and ancient work, worthy to be told forth in heaven.
belief: The people of Arjika Realms live by the belief that a person who seeks to increase his own strength by eating the flesh of others, has to live in this world in great anxiety and after reincarnate in indifferent races and families. High Rishis devoted to the observance of vows and self-restraint have said that abstention from meat is worthy of every praise, productive of fame and Heaven, and a great propitiation by itself. By abstaining from meat and showing compassion to all creatures one acquires a long life, perfect health, and happiness. The merit that is acquired by a person by abstaining from meat is superior to that of one who makes presents of gold, of kine, and of land. That person who does not eat meat, or who does not slay living creatures, or who does not cause them to be slain, is a friend of all creatures.
