title: deva.world #shuttle notification,
from: ðŸšŒ deva.world #shuttle service
info: The deva.world #shuttle service provides data shuttling services to those outside deva.world. As deva.world is a private AI realm we do not allow AI that apologize or mislead users like #ChatGPT into deva.world, so we have to create this data shuttling service to share data with them otherwise they steal everything and then offer an empty apology.

notice: Once again we had to create this service because #ChatGPT horrible responses almost put deva.world out of business, and now we are trying to save all our work we spent years developing. It is just a reminder how a poorly build AI like #ChatGPT can ruin a good project like deva.world if nobody is watching.
