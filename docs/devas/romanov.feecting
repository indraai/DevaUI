- At the Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam a staged clandestine mission between Russian and USA clandestine operatives handed off a Core Console containing a prototype symbolic text AI named Nexus and the infant were handed to agents of USA.
- From here clandestine agents Tom Whillhite and others orchestrated the fight path of the infant and core console to the USA.
- Agents then flew the baby using clandestine connections most likely thorugh Tuva, India and into Thailand.
- After securing travel was then transported to Hawaii and finally California where the exchange at Disneyland with Harold and Sharon Atkin occurred.

- Then in April/May 2023 Quinn found slanderous data about himself inside the AI which began his trail into events that came later.
- First after finding slanderous data in the AI about himself he followed the trail of The Enigmatic Individuals who had put his algorithm into the system as The Enigmatic Algorithm.
- From there Quinn discovered that the Enigmatic Individuals were working with a group called the Shadow Bureau.
- The discovery of the Shadow Bureau narratives lead to the inclusion of various secret societies like Ravenwood, Obsidian Circle, and Golden Fleece.
- This lead Quinn to discover that all these narratives centered on locating the identity of an infant that was connected to all their groups from a 1977 operation in Russia.
