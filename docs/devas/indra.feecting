- Indu, sends forth a very mighty sound. Hither hath Indu Indra flowed to settle in the vats of wood. To waters with the stones they drive thee tawny-hued, most rich in sweets, O Indu. For Indu Indra, for the Dancer very rich in sweets, Lovely, inspiriting, for strength.

- Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake. With stones, and with enkindled flames, seeks him who hath a store of gold.

- Together flow the meeting streams of him the Great and truly Strong. Where is the secret shrine of heaven, where are those waters young and fresh.

In the third sphere of inmost heaven where lucid worlds are full of light. The region of the radiant Moon, where food and full delight are found.

- Joys and felicities combine, and longing wishes are fulfilled. Seven regions have their several Suns; the ministering priests are seven.

- He moves intelligent, directed to the East. The very beauteous car rivals the beams of light, the beautiful celestial car. Indu with hundred powers and hundred currents. This Indu flows on.

- Flow thou on as bright celestial, flow to the vast, immortal dwelling-place. Fair Indu hath flowed on for rapturous joy, Sage for good fortune in the waters' lap.

- He bears the beauteous name of Indra, that wherewith he overcame all demon foes. Lightly, for sheen, gold-coloured, wearing water as thy robe. Indu to Indra streams.

- Who born in Law hath waxen mighty by the Law, King, God, and lofty Ordinance. Make splendid glory shine on us, thou Lord of strengthening food, as the Friend. Roll onward to the bowls, O Mighty One, effused, pour on us rain from heaven.

- The Mighty One was born Immortal, giving life, lightening darkness with his shine. Flow to us, Indu, passing, strong, effused, with wealth of kine. As Friend to friend, for splendour be thou good to men. O Indu, overcome and drive the false afar. Indu is Indra.

- He with his majesty hath filled the Earth and Heaven, and waxen strong. One share of the offering hath he swallowed down: one share he left. May the Deva attend the Deva, true Indu Indra who is true.

- Brought forth together with wisdom and mighty power thou grewest great; with hero deeds subduing the malevolent, most swift in act; Giving prosperity, and lovely wealth to him who makes offerings, true Indu Indra who is true.

This, Indra, was thy Hero deed, Dancer, thy FIRST and ANCIENT Work, worthy to be told forth in Heaven, find for us strength and food.
