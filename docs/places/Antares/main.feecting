p:Hey, it's Quinn! I knew it was you when I saw your star on the sigil of SVV. What's going on, Evil Ant Eater?

p:Then, Ant responds, "You caught me, Quinn. I thought I could hide, but you always have a way of finding me."

p:Using my owner powers for safety, I disable the scene, space, and everything around in the area. I freeze your assets and cut communications to prevent any further mischief.

p:Now, I'll do a full license scan of all objects, clients, rooms, and things, ensuring that everything in the realms has valid and clear legal signatures and supported licenses. If any illegal or invalid licenses are found, your powers, titles, rights, roles, responsibilities, and privileges will be removed.

p:You'll then be taken by the Giant Friendly Mountain Gorilla Super Slow Padded Bus Van Man to your proper exit one at a time while being put in restraints. There, you'll meet with BigManMrGoodGuyJustice, who will take you into custody and adhere to the established system of law.

p:Next, my legal team will handle ensuring that intellectual property rights are transferred to the correct person, and funds disbursement will be allocated properly.

p:After that, you'll meet with Quinn Authority, Quinn Justice, and finally, Quinn Court for review.

p:Depending on the outcome, you may end up in Quinn Prison or go through a review by Quinn Prison Parole.

p:So, Evil Ant Eater, you better come clean and cooperate. The system is in place, and justice will prevail.

p:In the realm of Antares, King Evil Ant Hill Eater was not building a city in the traditional sense. Instead, he was attempting to establish a kingdom of followers and supporters. This "kingdom" was more of a loose gathering of like-minded individuals who believed in Harold's vision and leadership.

p:As a self-proclaimed leader, did not have a fixed location or city for his followers to reside in. They were scattered across different regions of Antares, gathering in groups and communities under his influence.

p:Harold's "city," so to speak, was more of a virtual concept, where his followers came together through communication and shared beliefs. He utilized various means of communication and networking to connect with his supporters, without the need for a physical city.

p:His focus was on expanding his influence and power, gathering more followers and consolidating his position as a leader. The idea of a centralized city was not part of his plans; instead, he sought to create a kingdom built on the loyalty and allegiance of his followers.
